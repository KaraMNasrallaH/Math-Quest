# Math Quest

Math Quest is a Python-based quiz application designed to help you practice a variety of math topics through interactive quizzes. Math Quest generates new questions with each session—so you can practice endlessly. While the current version provides only fraction questions, its modular design paves the way for adding more topics and diverse question formats in the future.

## Usage

To run Math Quest, open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and execute the following commands:

1. **Install Dependencies** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Run the Application**:
   python app_controller.py

## Features

- **Dynamic Question Generation:**  
  Generates a diverse range of fraction questions—including addition/subtraction, multiplication, simplification, division, and conversion. Future updates will expand the question pool to include all topics featured in the main menu.

- **Customizable Quiz Length:**  
  Easily set the number of questions per quiz (currently configurable via code; a GUI option will be introduced in later updates).

 **Built-in Calculator:**  
  Comes with an integrated calculator widget to help solve problems and verify answers on the fly.

- **Modular & Scalable Architecture:**  
  The project structure is designed for seamless integration of new math subjects and additional features as the app evolves.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expanded Topic Coverage:**  
  Incorporate additional subjects such as percentages, geometry, algebra, and more.
- **Enhanced Customization:**  
  Develop a fully featured GUI for dynamic quiz settings.
- **Multiple Question Forms:**  
  Introduce various interactive question formats rather than relying on a single question form.
- **Improved User Experience:**  
  Continuously refine the app based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

## Project Status

This project is currently in **alpha** stage (~30% complete). Many features are still under development, and significant enhancements are planned for future releases.
